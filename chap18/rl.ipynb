If there were some hidden state then you may need to consider past actions and observations in order to try to infer the hidden state of the environment. For example, if the environment only revealed the position of the cart but not its velocity, you would have to consider not only the current observation but also the previous observation in order to estimate the current velocity. Another example is if the observations are noisy: you may want to use the past few observations to estimate the most likely current state.

Here's an analogy: suppose you go to a restaurant for the first time, and all the dishes look equally appealing so you randomly pick one. If it turns out to be good, you can increase the probability to order it next time, but you shouldn't increase that probability to 100%, or else you will never try out the other dishes, some of which may be even better than the one you tried."
