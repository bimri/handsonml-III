In the case of the CartPole environment, there are just two possible actions (left or right), so we only need one output neuron: it will output the probability `p` of the action 0 (left), and of course the probability of action 1 (right) will be `1 - p`."

    "In this particular environment, the past actions and observations can safely be ignored, since each observation contains the environment's full state. If there were some hidden state then you may need to consider past actions and observations in order to try to infer the hidden state of the environment. For example, if the environment only revealed the position of the cart but not its velocity, you would have to consider not only the current observation but also the previous observation in order to estimate the current velocity. Another example is if the observations are noisy: you may want to use the past few observations to estimate the most likely current state. Our problem is thus as simple as can be: the current observation is noise-free and contains the environment's full state."

    "You may wonder why we plan to pick a random action based on the probability given by the policy network, rather than just picking the action with the highest probability. This approach lets the agent find the right balance between _exploring_ new actions and _exploiting_ the actions that are known to work well. Here's an analogy: suppose you go to a restaurant for the first time, and all the dishes look equally appealing so you randomly pick one. If it turns out to be good, you can increase the probability to order it next time, but you shouldn't increase that probability to 100%, or else you will never try out the other dishes, some of which may be even better than the one you tried."
